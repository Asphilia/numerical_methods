There will be mistakes. Do not take the results of the methods at face value, always add a few grains of salt.

## Includes:
* Cubic Spline interpolation with natural border conditions (splines.py)
* Polynomial interpolation (interpolation.py)
* Newton interpolation, newton polynom (interpolation.py)
* Trapez integration (integration.py)
* Integration with Simpson-rule (integration.py)
* Newton-Cotes integration (integration.py)
* Composite integration with newton-cotes (integration.py)
* romberg-algorithm for integration (integration_additions.py)
* addaptive-algorithm for integration (integration_additions.py)

## Planed:
* Cubic Spline interpolation with not-a-knot condition
* householder transformation
